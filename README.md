# Joint-Communications-and-Sensing-Design-for-Multi-Carrier-MIMO-Systems
Source code for the paper "Joint Communications and Sensing Design for Multi-Carrier MIMO Systems" in IEEE SSP 2023.

I have already uploaded the simulation dataset for the figures in the paper. The code is ready to run.

Config the system properly before running. The current configuration is ready for testing.
Run file main_SNR.m to obtain the rate and beampattern.
Run file main_Kjcas.m to obtain the rate-beampattern MSEs tradeoff versus J.
Run gen_channel.m if you want to generate another dataset for another system.
Please kindly cite my paper if you find the code helpful.
